    <H2>Welcome to my websites about page</H2>

    <h3>section 1</h3>
    <p>
        The domestic cat is usually a small furry animal with attitude, 4 legs, sharp claws, teeth and a tail. 
         It can be an indoor or outdoor pet. 
         It tolerates some humans that will meet its need of food, water and shelter. 
        It can bite and/or claw without provocation.
        Its very good at hiding, and that will be my blog for today.
